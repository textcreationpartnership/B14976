            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>Wee had thought to have given over printing our Forraigne avisoes, for that the Licencer (out of a partiall affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) would not oftentimes let passe apparant truth, and in other things (oftentimes) so crosse and alter which made vs almost weary of Printing, but he being vanished (and that Office fallen vpon another, more vnderstanding in these Forraine affaires, and as you will finde more candid.) We are againe (by the favour of his Majestie and the State) resolved to goe on in Printing if we shall finde the World to give a better acceptation of them, (then of late) by their Weekly buying them. It is well knowne these Novels are well esteemed in all parts of the World (but heere) by the more Iudicious, which wee can impute to no other but the discontinuance of them, and the vncertaine dayes of publishing them, which if the Post faile vs not wee shall keepe a constant Day every weeke therein, whereby every man may certainly expect them, and so wee take leave,</p>

The Duke of Bavaria hath commanded <hi>Heidelberg</hi> and the whole Country to deliver up their accounts, what hath been contributed to the warre since the yeare 1622. which amounteth to a mighty summe of money, and the said Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> brings it all into his owne account at Ratisbone, to shew thereby how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tunnes of gold the Palatinate hath cost, though the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate paid the mony it selfe, so that any one may easily see, what mind he hath to restore againe the Palatinate, in the meane time the Spanyards use great cruelty in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate, insomuch that the poore subjects must give all what they have, and it is to be feared, that those of <hi>Heidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> will have a hard winter.

On the other side, the French at Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zall have likewise set at liberty 24 Spanish officers, amongst which are two Captaines, and 11 Ensignes, and 50 common souldiers; but when they thought to goe upon the river of Poe, towards Valenza, they fell neer Breme, upon a rocke, which made the ship fly in peeces, and all the souldiers (except two, which saved themselves by swimming) were drowned. The

               <p>From Stockholm in Swedland is written, that in the said Kingdome so great preparations for warre, are made by sea, the like hath not been by mens memory. <hi>Item,</hi> that against the 7. of Iannuary next ensuing, all Prelates, and Nobles, are called to a diet, which is to be kept at Stockholm, which makes men to thinke, that they have matters of great importance in hand.</p>

               <p>SIR, I cannot let passe, to give you a briefe rehears ll of the sudden alteration here, viz. Vpon Saturday last the pro cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the Secretary <hi>Migel de Vas Gonsaluez</hi> was slaine in his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Palace by the Nobility, and throwne out at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in the <hi>Terrara de passa,</hi> where his corps did remaine all that day and night following, being footed and stript by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, his beard, eares, and some of his members cut off: and next morning it was conveyed in most abject manner to the <hi>Miseri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia.</hi> Presently when the Secretary was slaine, the Gentry
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:177417:27"/>rode through most streets of the citie, well accompanied and armed, crying, <hi>Viva Don Guan quarto,</hi> which was so generally received by the people, that there appeared not the least oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, all taking armes in the cause, appearing under their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours in the <hi>Terra de passa,</hi> to wait the command of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, now Governours. The day was solemnized with joy, by ringing of bells, and discharging the great ordnance of ships in the river, which for the most part were English. Sunday the second of December, the castle of Lisbone rendred to the Nobility, and two dayes after the castle of Bellyne, for want of victuals, and now they are upon S. <hi>Guans,</hi> that doth yet hold out, but within few dayes will be forced also to render.</p>
               <p>The King came to the citie two dayes since, and now is a stage building upon <hi>Terra de passa,</hi> for him to bee sworne and crowned, which the King doth desire to doe in the view of the world, to shew, as he saith, that hee comes to enjoy his right, which hath been so long detained from him.</p>
               <p>The Portuguezes have showne such celerity as is to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mited, there having not been in this accord, passing three or foure slaine, which made some resistance upon the comming of the Nobility to the Secretary.</p>
               <p>The post from Spaine, Madrid, and Sivell, do not now goe, which will breed much alteration in trade, especially with such as are <hi>Cambia-dores:</hi> and likewise I doubt we shall find<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> much alteration for our English commodities, all now changing the fashions of apparrell, leaving their owne, and imitate the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and French fashions what possibly they can. Thus besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching God that all may be for the best, to whose most holy protection I commit you, and rest yours to command:</p>
